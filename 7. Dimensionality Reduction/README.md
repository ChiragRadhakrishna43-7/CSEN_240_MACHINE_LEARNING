<h1>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</h1>
a. The principal components can be obtained via EVD on XXT ( where X is the training dataset). They are linear combinations of the original variables. <br/>
b. The first principal component captures the most variation in the data. <br/>
c. SVD is a factorization of a matrix into three matrices. <br/>
d. Left singular vectors of X are the same as eigenvectors of XXT. <br/>

<h1>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):</h1>
a. LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique used for feature extraction. <br/>
b. LDA aims to find a linear combination of features that maximizes the separation between different classes. <br/>
c. The Fisher criterion aims to maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. <br/>
d. The output of LDA includes the projection of data points onto the extracted discriminant features. <br/>
