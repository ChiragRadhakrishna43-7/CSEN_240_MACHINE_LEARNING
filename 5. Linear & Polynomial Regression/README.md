<h1>Linear & Polynomial Regression</h1>
<p align = "justify">a. Linear regression predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables.<br/>
b. A goal of linear regression is to find the line of best fit that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. <br/>
c. Polynomial regression is a machine learning technique used to model non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. <br/>
d. Polynomial regression can suffer from overfitting when the degree of the polynomial is too high. <br/>
e. Regularized polynomial regression involves adding a penalty term to the cost function, which reduces the magnitude of the polynomial coefficients and prevents overfitting. <br/>
