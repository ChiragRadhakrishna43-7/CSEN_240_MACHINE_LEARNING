<h1> DECISION TREES </h1>

<p align = "justify"> . Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm. It can be used to solve a classification problem. It is a tree-like structure that consists of nodes and edges. Each node represents a 
decision or a test on a feature. <br/>A top-down approach, where the tree is built from the root node downwards. At each level, the algorithm selects the feature that best separates the data, and creates a node for that feature.
The splitting criterion is a measure of how well a feature splits the data into distinct classes. <br/>Gini impurity and entropy are examples of splitting criteria. It has a special kind of decision surface: hyperrectangles
Decision Trees are sensitive to axis orientation.
