<h1>Logistic Regression</h1>
a. Logistic regression predicts binary or categorical outcomes with probability. <br/>
b. Logistic regression uses the logistic function (also known as sigmoid function) to output a number between 0 and 1. <br/>
c. Sigmoid function is represented as 𝜎(−𝑡) = 1 − 𝜎(𝑡). <br/>
d. Softmax regression can be used for multi-class classification problems. <br/>
e. The output of the softmax function represents class probabilities. The predicted class is the one with the highest probability. <br/>
f. The cross-entropy loss function is typically used in softmax regression, not the mean squared error. <br/>
g. Softmax regression uses gradient descent to minimize the cost function. <br/>

<h1>K-Means</h1>
a. K-means is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into k groups. <br/>
b. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster. <br/>
c. K-means is sensitive to the initial choice of cluster centers and may converge to suboptimal solutions. <br/>
